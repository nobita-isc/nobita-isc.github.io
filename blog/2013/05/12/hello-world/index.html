<p>Welcome to my new blog, hope you will have a lot of fun here !</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started by introducing myself&hellip;</p>

<p>My name is Vu Xuan Duong, from Vietnam. Currently I am working as a software developer for a software company in Vietnam. I was studying in Japan for 2 years, so I can speak Japanese pretty well. I dont mind if you leave a comment in English, Japanese or Vietnamese.</p>

<p>Currently I want to learn Visual C++ for programming in Windows Enviroment due to job requirement. I am C related language lover but also concern in web programming (both server and client side). I was taking advance in researching about Internet Security in my university. Therefore, it would be glad to see/ share something about security issues in my blog.</p>

<p>Have fun !</p>
